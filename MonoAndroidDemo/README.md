MonoAndroidDemo
===============

This is the main TeeChart for Xamarin.Android demo. It includes a complete gallery of all the chart styles included in the library.

Charts here are interactive, supporting pinch zoom and panning. Via the menu you can change toggle 2D/3D view, change themes using some built-in options and also export the charts on screen to an image and share it. 

## Sample Requirements

You'll need TeeChart for Xamarin.Android evaluation or registered version to run this example. Fully functional evaluation version can be obtained at https://www.steema.com/downloads/net_android
